## Story

An organization called the FPO was in control of the Kyrac region. It did many terrible experiments on both pokemon and humans. 

Many people, citizens and FPO members, didn’t agree with these experiments. 

Internal strife within the FPO, along with the discontent at the experiments, led to the FPO splitting into three organizations–the FPI, the FPE, and the original but now weaker FPO.

A secret, “perfect” legendary the FPO was working on was also split into three different forms that fled across the region. Two of them are known. The FPI and the FPE are currently searching for them so they can reunite them and dominate the region, and perhaps the world, with their new legendary.

You have never met your father. But you do know that he is the founder of the FPO. As you embark on your journey, he gives you one important mission:

Stop the FPI and FPE, and if necessary, free the known two legendaries from their hands.

You won’t be alone in this daunting mission. You’ll meet many enemies, but you’ll meet just as many allies in your mission to save the region! Maybe you’ll even see your father for the first time, too!

## Features

### Gym System

The main story has 12 gyms + 4 gyms in the post game. You can do these gyms in any order you like but there are a few limitations which I'll explain right here and now:

The gyms can be challenged in sets like this:

Gym 1-3 (Dark, Flying and Ground)

Gym 4-5 (Ice and Rock)

Gym 6-8 (Fire, Grass and Steel)

Gym 9-12 (Psychic, Normal, Ghost, Dragon)

Gym 13-16 (Poison, Fighting, Electric and Bug)

I'll clearify what this exactly means:

For example: The first 3 gyms can be challenged in any other you want which means that you can skip the first gym and eventually defeat the 2nd gym or 3rd gym first.

If you really want to know:

-For the first set (gym 1-3) there are 6 different ways to defeat these gyms.

-For the second set (gym 4-5) there are 2 different ways to defeat these gyms.

-For the third set (gym 6-8) there are again 6 different ways to defeat these gyms.

-For the fourth and fifth set (gym 9-12 and gym 13-16) there are each 24 different ways to defeat these gyms.

The levels of the gyms will change according to how you defeat them.

Certain Routes and events will have effect on the gym's levels as well.

Here are a few examples of possible ways to defeat the first set of gyms:

Gym 1 -> Route 1 -> Route 2 -> Route 3 -> Gym 2 -> Route 4 -> Gym 3 = this is the normal order just as a reference

(Route 2 has no effect on the gym's levels and so isn't mentioned below)

Route 1 -> Gym 1 -> Route 3 -> Gym 2 -> Route 4 -> Gym 3 

Route 1 -> Route 4 -> Gym 3 -> Gym 1 -> Route 3 -> Gym 2

Route 1 -> Route 3 -> Gym 2 -> Gym 1 -> Route 4 -> Gym 3

### Elite Four System

In this game you'll notice that when you defeat the elite four a second time, the elite four members have been changed.µ

First Round:
- 1st Member: Fairy Type
- 2nd Member: Electric Type
- 3rd Member: Poison Type
- 4th Member: ??? Type
- Champion: ??? Type

You might wonder why the ??? on the 4th Member and Champion, this has to do with one of the final mission in the story.

Second Round:
- 1st Member: Dragon Type
- 2nd Member: Electric Type
- 3rd Member: Steel Type
- 4th Member: Flying Type
- Champion: Mixed Type

Third Round or First Rematch:
- 1st Member: Fairy Type
- 2nd Member: Bug Type
- 3rd Member: Poison type
- 4th Member: Water Type

As you might notice, there are a total of 8 elite four members. 

This means that every time you challenge the Elite Four again, there'll be made a selection of 4 members out of these 8. 

This gives a total of 1680 different possibilities.

It also means that you basically never know which Elite Four member will be first and who will be next (The order is determened from the moment you enter the first elite four member's room and will not change upon soft-resetting your game.)

### New Forms 

In this game there'll be a new mechanism that'll change the typing of a pokémon. This form is also known as the Kyracian Form of a Pokémon. 

It works similar to how mega evolution works but it's been triggered outside of battle
