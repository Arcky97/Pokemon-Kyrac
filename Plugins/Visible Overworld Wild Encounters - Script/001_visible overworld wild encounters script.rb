  #                         - by derFischae (Credits if used please)   #
  #                                                                    #
  #====================================================================#

# This script is for Pokémon Essentials v20 (for short PEv20). UPDATED TO VERSION 20.0.0.2.

# As in Pokemon Let's go Pikachu/Eevee or Pokemon Shild and Sword wild encounters
# pop up on the overworld, they move around and you can start the battle with
# them simply by moving to the pokemon. Clearly, you also can omit the battle
# by circling around them.


#===============================================================================
#            FEATURES
#===============================================================================

#  [*] Easy Install as Plugin
#  [*] see the pokemon on the overworld before going into battle
#  [*] no forced battling against overworld encounters
#  [*] Supports individual sprites for shiny, female and alternative forms
#  [*] plays the pokemon cry while spawning
#  [*] Overworld pokemon will despawn after some steps
#  [*] you can have instant wild battle and overworld spawning at the same time and set the propability of that in percentage
#  [*] In caves, pokemon don't spawn on impassable Rock-Tiles, which have the Tile-ID 4 
#  [*] In water, pokemon won't spawn above other tiles, which made them stuck or walk on ground
#  [*] See "advanced features" and "additional features by add-ons" below for more (e.g. additional animations...)

# ADVANCED FEATURES [/b]
#  [*] Set the size of the area around the player where pokemon can spawn
#  [*] Choose whether encounters occure on all terrains or only on the terrain of the player
#  [*] Allow or forbid water pokemon to spawn on border
#  [*] Set movement of overworld pokemon depending on its properties
#  [*] Choose whether you can battle water pokemon while not surfing or not
#  [*] set steps a pokemon remains on map before despawning depending on pokemon properties 
#  [*] You can check during the events :on_wild_species_chosen, :on_wild_pokemon_created, :on_calling_wild_battle ... if you are battling a spawned pokemon with the global variable $PokemonGlobal.battlingSpawnedPokemon
#  [*] You can check during the events :on_wild_species_chosen and :on_wild_pokemon_created if the pokemon is created for spawning on the map or created for a different reason with the Global variable $PokemonGlobal.creatingSpawningPokemon
#  [*] If you want to add a procedure that modifies a pokemon only for spawning but not before battling then you can use the Event :on_wild_pokemon_created_for_spawning

# ADDITIONAL FEATURES BY ADD-ONS (for PEv19, might be outdated, but feel free to test):
#  [*] Aggressive Encounters Add-On
#    [*] introduces aggressive encounters, which are pokemon that chase the player after spawning
#    [*] aggressive encounters may only start to chase if the player comes them to close
#    [*] set the move speed, move frequency and move type of aggressive pokemon
#    [*] aggressive ecounters are restricted to player movements
#    [*] add animations to aggressive encounters. See Additional Animations -Add On and TrankerGolD's animations for aggressive encounters
#        at https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10395100&postcount=383 to include spawning animations in your game
#  [*] Additional Animations Add-On
#    [*] manage different appear animations of overworld spawning encounters depending on encounter type and pokemon properties
#    [*] Play animations while PokeEvent is visible on screen, such as a shiny animation
#    [*] See also the animations by TrankerGolD for aggressive encounters, water encounters, and shiny encounters https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10395100&postcount=383
#  [*] Different Spawn And Normal Encounters (like in Pokemon Sword/Shield) Add-On
#    [*] Introduces Overworld Encounter Types you can set in your encounters.txt PBS-file.
#    [*] This allows you to define different encounters for overworld spawning and instant battling on the same map.
#  [*] Max Spawn Add-On
#    [*] Define a maximal limit of spawned pokemon on the overworld at the same time.
#    [*] After reaching that limit MAX_SPAWN no pokemon will spawn until another pokemon despawned.
#  [*] Additional Despawn Methods Add-On
#    [*] Choose to remove PokeEvent distanced on screen from the player with REMOVE_DISTANCED
#    [*] The distance (steps) is edited in DISTANCE_VANISH and DISTANCE_VANISH_SHINY
#    [*] Remove by time chronometer with REMOVE_PROLONGED
#    [*] Use your own overworld spawn chance in VISIBLE_ENCOUNTER_PROBABILITY
# [*] Own Minimum Spawn Chance
#    [*] The Spawn probability of the first encounter and later ones are similar.
#    [*] Spawning does not interact with the encounter chance for normal encounters.
#    [*] Increase the average spawning time of pokemon by setting MAX_ENCOUNTER_REDUCED larger than zero in the settings section of this script
#  [*] Fixed Spawn Probability Add-On
#    [*] Define your own overworld spawn chance in Percentage
#    [*] Spawn chance becomes independent from the default PEv19.1 encounter chance calculator
#  [*] Variable Spawn/Normal Encounter Proportion During Game  
#    [*] You can change the percentage between overworld spawning and normal encounters in story driven events during playthrough
#    [*] in Percentage, from only normal encounters to only spawning encounters
#  [*] Automatic Spawning Add-On
#    [*] Choose whether pokemon spawn automatically or only while moving the player
#    [*] Set the speed of automatic spawning
#  [*] Randomized Spawning Add-On
#    [*] It will randomize overworld encounters
#  [*] Ditto Transform Add-On
#    [*] Like in Pokemon Go, transformable Pokemon such as Ditto get the overworld appearence of different species
#    [*] Choose in settings if completely random, set by a list of candidates or set by the map encounters
#  [*] Remove Poke Events on load/save/transfer Add-On
#    [*] Remove overworld encounters on load/save and on map transfer
#  [*] Overworld Lavender Town Ghosts Add-On
#    [*] Shows ghost sprite for overworld encounters
#    [*] requires Lavender Town Ghosts Plugin 
#    [*] You need to put a graphic, named "ghost.png", in your "/Graphisc/Characters/" folder of your project. This graphic is not provided here, but maybe you can easily find some resource, for example search for "shiny missingNo [Ghost Form]".


#===============================================================================
#            INSTALLATION
#===============================================================================

# Installation as simple as it can be.
# [1] Add Graphics: Either get the resources from Gen 8 Project https://reliccastle.com/resources/670/
#  and install the "Graphics/Characters" folder in your game file system.
#  Or you place your own sprites for your pokemon/fakemon with the right names in your "\Graphics\Characters\Follower" folder and your shiny sprites in your "\Graphics\Characters\Follower shiny" folder. 
#  The right name of sprites is:
#    usual form     - SPECIES.png   where SPECIES is the species name in capslock (e.g. PIDGEY.png)
#    alternate form - SPECIES_n.png where n is the number of the form (e.g. PIKACHU_3.png)
#    female form    - SPECIES_female.png or SPECIES_n_female (e.g. PIDGEY_female.png or PIKACHU_3_female.png)
# [2] Add Script: Follow this link https://github.com/VisibleOverworldWildEncounters/V20 and copy the folder "Visible Overworld Wild Encounters - Script" to your "/plugins/" folder.
# [3] Change Settings: Open the script file in the folder and change the parameters in the settings section therein as you like. Details descriptions about the parameters can be found there as well. 
# [4] Install Add-Ons (the other folders): There are a lot of Add-Ons and parameter settings for your personal optimal solution. So, Copy Add-Ons in your "/plugins/" folder and edit parameters in settings of that Add-Ons to your liking. Some Add-On and parameter combinations can produce lag, e.g. a high spawning rate without a spawning cap, or e.g. "NO_OF_CHOSEN_TILES=0" (or too high) when having other scripts like Pokemon Following.
# [5] Enjoy!

#===============================================================================

module VisibleEncounterSettings
  #------------- SPAWN RATE AND SPAWN PROPABILITY ------------ 
  INSTANT_WILD_BATTLE_PROPABILITY = 0 # default 0.
  # This parameter holds the default propability of normal to overworld encountering.
  # The propability is stored in percentage with possible values 0,1,2,...,100.
  # <= 0           - means only overworld encounters, no instant battles
  # > 0 and < 100  - means overworld encounters and normal encounters at the same time.
  # >= 100         - means only normal encounters and instant battles as usual, no overworld spawning
  
  #--------------- SPAWN POSITION ------------------
  SPAWN_RANGE = 4 # default 4
  # This parameter needs to be a positive integer. It is the maximum range from the player a PokeEvent will be able to spawn 

  RESTRICT_ENCOUNTERS_TO_PLAYER_MOVEMENT = false # default false
  # true - means that water encounters are popping up
  #       if and only if player is surfing
  #       (perhaps decreases encounter rate)
  # false - means that all encounter types can pop up
  #        close to the player (as long as there is a suitable tile)
  
  NO_SPAWN_ON_BORDER = false # default false
  # true  - means that pokemon on water won't spawn in the border
  # false - means that pokemon will also spawn on the border of water   

  #---------------- GRAPHICS OF SPAWNED POKEMON -------------------
  SPRITES = [true, true, true] # default [true, true, true]
  # This parameter must be an array [alt_form, female, shiny] of three bools.
  # alt_form/ female/ shiny = false means: you don't use alternative/ female/ shiny sprites for your overworld encounter.
  #                         = true  means: alternative forms/ female forms/ shiny pokemon have there own special overworld sprite.
  # If true, make sure that you have the overworld sprites with the right name in your "\Graphics\Characters\Follower" folder
  # and that you have the shiny overworld sprites with the same name in your "\Graphics\Characters\Follower shiny" folder.
  # The right name of sprites:
  #  usual form     - SPECIES.png   where SPECIES is the species name in capslock (e.g. PIDGEY.png)
  #  alternate form - SPECIES_n.png where n is the number of the form (e.g. PIKACHU_3.png)
  #  female form    - SPECIES_female.png or SPECIES_n_female (e.g. PIDGEY_female.png or PIKACHU_3_female.png)
  
  USE_STEP_ANIMATION = true # default true
  #false - means that overworld encounters don't have a stop-animation
  #true - means that overworld encounters have a stop-animation similar as  
  #       following pokemon
  
  #------------------- MOVEMENT OF SPAWNED POKEMON -----------------------
  DEFAULT_MOVEMENT = [3, 3, 1] # default [3, 3, 1]
  # This parameter stores an array [move_speed, move_frequency, move_type] of three integers where
  # move_speed/ move_frequency/ move_type is the default movement speed/ frequency/ type of spawned PokeEvents.
  # See RPGMakerXP for more details (compare to autonomous movement of events).
  # speed/ frequency = 1   - means lowest movement speed/ frequency
  # speed/ frequency = 6   - means highest movement speed/ frequency
  # type = 0/ 1/ 3         - means no movement/ random movement/ run to player
  # ...

  Enc_Movements = [                  # default
    [:shiny?, true, 3, 4, nil],    # [:shiny?, true, 3, 4, 3] means that shiny encounters will be faster
    [:species, :SLOWPOKE, 1, 1, nil], # [:species, :SLOWPOKE, 1, 1, nil] means that slowpoke is very slow. It might still want to run random or to the player.
    [:nature, :NAUGHTY, nil, 4, 3] # [:nature, :NAUGHTY, nil, 4, 3] means pokemon with a naughty nature will run to the player and be faster
  ]
  # This parameter is used to change movement of spawned PokeEvents depending on the spawned pokemon.
  # The data is stored as an array of arrays. You can add your own arrays.s
  # The data is stored as an array of entries [variable, value, move_speed, move_frequency, move_type], where variable
  # is a variable or method which does not require parameters of the class Pokemon,
  # value is a possible outcome value of variable and move_speed, move_frequency and move_type are the movement speed,
  # frequency and type all PokeEvents should get if value == pokemon.variable.
  # nil  - means that the movement-parameter will not be changed.

  #--------------- BATTLING SPAWNED POKEMON ------------------
  BATTLE_WATER_FROM_GROUND = false #default true
  # this is used if you want to battle water pokemon without surfing
  # (default is true but I think is better in false)
  #false - means the battle wont start if not surfing 
  #true - means you can battle from the ground a pokemon from the water

  #--------------- VANISHING OF SPAWNED POKEMON AFTER STEPS -------------------
  DEFAULT_STEPS_BEFORE_VANISH = 10 # default 10
  # This is the number of steps a wild encounter goes by default before vanishing on the map.

  Add_Steps_Before_Vanish = [ # default
    [:shiny?, true, 8],       # [:shiny, true, 8]       - means that spawned shiny pokemon will more 8 steps longer on the map than default.
    [:species, :PIDGEY, -2]   # [:species, :PIDGEY, -2] - means that pidgeys will be gone faster (2 steps earlier).
  ]
  # This is an array of arrays. You can add your own conditions as an additional array. It must be of the form [variable, value, number] where
  # variable is a variable or an method that does not need any parameters of the class Pokemon,
  # value is a possible value of variable and number is the number of steps an pokemon goes more (or less) than default before vanishing on the map 
  # if it satisfies pokemon.variable == value
