#The 2 arguments required for the script to work are pocket and badge.
#Pocket is the number you see in the items.txt file that tells the game in which bag's pocket to put the item in, this is useful because then you can tell the script to randomly choose a ball item (pocket 3), healing item (pocket 2), TM item (pocket 4), etc
#Badge is used to lock the random item chosen to a limited selection (more explanation below).

#IMPORTANT: All items need to be in all caps and start with a ":" just like how you would do it in an event the normal way.
#The Constants below holds all the items that'll NOT be used by the script.
